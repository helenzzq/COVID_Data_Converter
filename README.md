# Assignment 2 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the assignment starter template up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You must have Python-3 and a package manager [pip] installed on your computer

Additionally you will need to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data constraints
- Must specify date in "MM-DD-YY"
- Please upload the data as the specified format given by the handout.
- If you want to upload time series data, must contain "time_series" in filename

### Running The Code

You can start by running main.py, which is in the folder COVIDMonitor. main.py has the main method that will start the program.
Please run the above bash command when you are in the parent folder: assignment-2-3-imjeffz-helenzzq.

```bash
python3 -m COVIDMonitor.main
```

## Running Tests

A starter template for unit tests can be found under tests/unit_tests.py

To run unit tests with coverage, run the following command:

```bash
pytest --cov-report term --cov=COVIDMonitor tests/unit_tests.py
```


## Code Crafstmanship
We use VS code built-in python extension IDE pack to format our code.
For paired coding, we use Live share extension in VS code so that we can code at the same time and any live changes will be reflected on both ends.
